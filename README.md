# PicoSerDe

AOT-first, reflection-free serialization framework. Five formats, one
unified API. Source-generated `ref struct` readers/writers with zero heap
allocation on the hot path — deployable under NativeAOT and trimming where
many serialization libraries cannot run.

## Test Coverage

Every module has its own suite, cross-validated against a competitor implementation:

| Module | Competitor | Cross-Validation |
|--------|:-----------|:----------------:|
| PicoJetson | System.Text.Json | ✅ bidirectional, all 19 property types |
| PicoToml | Tomlyn | ✅ bidirectional, 20 property types, NestedList via `[[key]]` |
| PicoYaml | YamlDotNet | ✅ bidirectional, 19 property types, DateOnly/TimeOnly converters |
| PicoIni | Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Ini | ✅ bidirectional, 16 property types |
| PicoMsgPack | MessagePack-CSharp | ✅ map/array dual-format, 14 property types |
| PicoSerDe.Core | — | — |
| Integration (cross-format) | — | Ignore-condition matrix, anon types, round-trips |

> Test counts are deliberately not pinned in this document: they change with every
> PR and a stale number is worse than none. Run `dotnet test PicoSerDe.slnx -c Debug`
> for the current totals. PicoJetson's suite is split across three projects
> (unit / integration / functional).
>
> Strictness/robustness regression tests live in dedicated per-format suites
> (`Strict*Tests`, `*StrictnessTests`, `*RobustnessTests`): wrong-typed input,
> trailing data, missing `required` members, malformed documents, chunked
> streaming and comment handling all fail loudly instead of silently producing
> defaults.

## Performance Summary

Numbers are measured, and the mode is labelled per row rather than mixed into one
column. "AOT vs AOT" is the strong claim: both sides compiled ahead of time and both
actually finish. It is only possible where the competitor supports NativeAOT.

Benchmarks: .NET 10, win-x64, AMD Ryzen 7 6800H. Ratios are speedup over the
competitor (higher is better); ranges are the spread over three consecutive runs on an
otherwise idle machine, and the win counts are scenarios won out of those attempted.

| Module | Competitor | AOT vs AOT | JIT vs JIT | Why the modes differ |
|--------|------------|:----------:|:----------:|----------------------|
| PicoJetson | System.Text.Json | **1.9–2.2x** (10–12/12) | — | STJ is AOT-ready, so no JIT row is needed |
| PicoMsgPack | MessagePack-CSharp | **1.8–1.9x** (3–4/4) | 1.3–1.5x (7–8/8) | see below |
| PicoIni | ini-parser | ~0.03–0.05x (~12 ms/POCO) | — | judge by absolute cost, see the ratio caveat |
| PicoToml | Tommy | ~0.18–0.20x | — | |
| PicoYaml | YamlDotNet | **~1.0x** (1–3/3) | — | parity, not a loss |

**Why PicoMsgPack has two rows.** MessagePack-CSharp builds formatters for enums and
generic collections at run time (`MakeGenericType` + `Activator.CreateInstance`), which
NativeAOT cannot do. Its `[MessagePackObject]` types with `string`/`int` only are
statically resolvable and run fine ahead of time — that is the AOT row, measured by
`PicoMsgPack.Benchmarks.Aot`. The unified cross-format benchmark adds `DayOfWeek`,
`Dictionary<string,string>` and `List<int>` to the same models, so under AOT it throws
`MissingMethodException: No parameterless constructor defined for type ...` on the first
complex model; that benchmark is therefore JIT-only and says so in its csproj.

**The INI ratio moves for reasons unrelated to INI.** `Speedup = baseline / candidate`,
and the candidate's absolute cost barely changed across two releases (11.6 ms to 12.1 ms)
while the baseline drifted between 250 and 600 μs — so the ratio swung from 0.05x to
0.03x without the candidate regressing. Judge INI by its absolute cost, not the ratio.

> JSON/MessagePack are faster than or competitive with their JIT-based
> alternatives even when both sides are compiled ahead of time. INI/TOML/YAML
> prioritize correct, reflection-free parsing over peak throughput — their
> competitors benefit from years of runtime-level optimizations (cached keys,
> direct span writes, dynamic code gen) that are incompatible with NativeAOT.
> PicoSerDe is the **only** option that runs at all in a fully-trimmed,
> self-contained NativeAOT deployment for these formats.

## Design

```csharp
// One API across all formats. The four text formats return string;
// MsgPack is binary and returns byte[].
JsonSerializer.Serialize<T>(value)                 // → string  (PicoJetson)
TomlSerializer.Serialize<T>(value)                 // → string  (PicoToml)
YamlSerializer.Serialize<T>(value)                 // → string  (PicoYaml)
IniSerializer.Serialize<T>(value)                  // → string  (PicoIni)
MsgPackSerializer.SerializeToUtf8Bytes<T>(value)   // → byte[]  (PicoMsgPack)
```

> `SerializeToUtf8Bytes` is the `byte[]` entry point (JSON has one too); the
> plain `Serialize` overloads of the text formats return `string`.

### Attribute-Driven Registration

PicoSerDe source generators discover types through **four independent pipelines**:

1. **Usage-driven** — calling `Serialize<T>()` or `Deserialize<T>()` triggers generation for `T`
2. **Generic attribute** — `[PicoSerializable]` marks a type for all referenced format modules
3. **Format-specific attribute** — `[PicoJsonSerializable]` / `[PicoIniSerializable]` / etc. marks a type for one format
4. **Shorthand attribute** — `[GenerateSerializer(typeof(T))]` for central registration

```csharp
// All referenced formats generate serializers
[PicoSerializable]
public class UserDto { public string Name { get; set; } }

// JSON only (PicoJetson)
[PicoJsonSerializable]
public class JsonOnlyDto { public string Label { get; set; } }

// Indirect — target type from any assembly
[PicoIniSerializable(typeof(ExternalLibrary.SharedDto))]
class Config { }

// Shorthand — equivalent to PicoSerializable(typeof(T))
[GenerateSerializer(typeof(UserDto))]
[GenerateSerializer(typeof(ProductDto))]
class PicoSerDeConfig { }
```

| Attribute | Scope | Defined in |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| `[PicoSerializable]` | All formats — direct or `typeof(T)` | `PicoSerDe.Core` |
| `[GenerateSerializer]` | Shorthand for `PicoSerializable(typeof(T))` | `PicoSerDe.Core` |
| `[PicoJsonSerializable]` | JSON only | `PicoJetson` |
| `[PicoIniSerializable]` | INI only | `PicoIni` |
| `[PicoTomlSerializable]` | TOML only | `PicoToml` |
| `[PicoMsgPackSerializable]` | MsgPack only | `PicoMsgPack` |
| `[PicoYamlSerializable]` | YAML only | `PicoYaml` |

No attributes are required for basic usage — calling `Serialize<T>()` automatically triggers generation.

## Key Features

### Strict Deserialization (fail-loud, STJ-compatible semantics)

Deserialization validates input shape and types instead of silently producing
default values:

- **Wrong-typed values throw** `FormatException` — `{"age":"abc"}` into an `int`
  property throws instead of yielding `0`
- **Invalid string escapes throw** — RFC 8259 only allows `\" \\ \/ \b \f \n \r \t \uXXXX`;
  unknown escapes (e.g. `\q`) are rejected instead of being silently unescaped (`\b` and `\f` are
  now decoded correctly)
- **Leading commas throw** — `,5` and `[,1]` are invalid JSON and are rejected
- **Top-level `null` returns `null`** for reference-type targets (STJ semantics);
  value-type targets throw
- **Trailing data after the document root throws**
- **Missing `required` members throw** — C# `required` properties are enforced at
  runtime across object, nested, streaming, and polymorphic paths
- **`PicoDocument.IsValid` performs full structural validation** — mismatched
  brackets, bare values in objects, missing property values, and multiple root
  values are all rejected (token-level checks are not enough)
- **Arrays**: `null` elements are allowed for reference-type elements and throw
  for value-type elements; wrong-typed elements throw
- **Comments** (`ReadCommentHandling.Skip`): malformed comment syntax (`/x`) and
  unterminated block comments throw instead of being silently swallowed
- **Streaming** (`DeserializeFromStreamAsync<T>`) honors the same semantics —
  `UnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow` and top-level `null` handling are identical
  to the direct path (v2026.4.11+; both paths share one generated dispatch
  chain). Struct DTOs and propertyless types have no streaming delegate
  (`DeserializeFromStreamAsync<Struct>` throws `InvalidOperationException`)
- **MsgPack rejects empty payloads and trailing bytes** — a zero-length buffer
  or bytes after the root value throw `FormatException`
- **INI list values parse strictly per element kind** — malformed numbers,
  booleans, dates, etc. throw `FormatException` (never silently default to `0`/
  `false`), and formatting/parsing is culture-invariant
- **INI enum values parse strictly** — an unparseable enum text now throws
  `FormatException` naming the member and offset; it used to fall back silently
  to the default (`0`) enum member
- **TOML/YAML/INI unquoted empty values are `null`, not `""`** — `Key =` (TOML/
  INI) and `Key:` (YAML) assign `null` to nullable members; INI previously
  produced the empty string. Quoted `""` is still the empty string
- **`float` keeps its own precision** — `JsonWriter.WriteNumber(float)` emits the
  shortest round-trippable single-precision text instead of widening to `double`
  and printing the widened value

### Null Semantics

Null is not portable across the five formats, so "write a null" and "read a
null" are spelled out per format below. Everything here is observed behaviour of
the generated code, not a format-theoretic claim.

**Writing a null member** (default options, `DefaultIgnoreCondition = Never`):

| Format | Null member written as | Under `WhenWritingNull` |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| JSON | `"key":null` | member omitted |
| MsgPack | `nil` (`0xC0`; the map/array header is adjusted) | member omitted |
| TOML | member omitted — TOML has no null value | member omitted |
| YAML | member omitted — YAML has no null value on write | member omitted |
| INI | member omitted — INI has no null value | member omitted |

Because the three section-based formats drop the member, **a null does not
round-trip through TOML/YAML/INI**: reading the document back leaves the target
at its default, which is the property initializer's value when one exists.
JSON and MsgPack write an explicit null and do round-trip.

**Reading a null** — accepted spellings and what the target receives:

| Format | Null spellings accepted | nullable target (`T?`, `string?`) | non-nullable value type | non-nullable `string` |
|--------|-------------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| JSON | `null` | `null` | `FormatException` | `FormatException` |
| MsgPack | `nil` | `null` | `FormatException` | `FormatException` |
| TOML | `Key =` (no value), or unquoted `null` (any case) | `null` | `FormatException` | `null` |
| YAML | `Key:` (no value), `~`, or unquoted `null` (any case) | `null` | `FormatException` | `null` |
| INI | `Key =` (no value), or unquoted `null` (any case) | `null` | `FormatException` | `null` |

Rules that hold in every format:

- **A quoted scalar is never null.** `Key = ""` is the empty string and
  `Key = "null"` is the four-character string `null`; both are values, not
  omissions.
- **A missing member is not an error.** It leaves the target at its default.
- **An unquoted empty value *is* the null literal** in TOML/YAML/INI — `Key =`
  with nothing after it assigns `null`; it does not mean "member missing".
- **A null aimed at a non-nullable value type fails loudly** with
  `FormatException` instead of silently leaving `0` / `false` / `Guid.Empty`.
- **The non-nullable `string` column is the generators' NRT-lenient contract:**
  TOML/YAML/INI assign `null!` to an unannotated `string`, while JSON/MsgPack
  keep requiring a value token and reject the null.
- **Scope:** these rules cover scalar members (string, numeric, temporal, enum,
  Guid, and their nullable forms). Collection, object and dictionary branches
  keep their own empty-value semantics and are not routed through the
  null-literal path.

### Polymorphic Deserialization (Type Discriminator)

Base types declare derived types at compile time. Zero reflection, AOT-safe. Since v2026.3.0.

```csharp
[PicoSerializable]
[PicoDerivedType(typeof(MessageEntry), "message")]
[PicoDerivedType(typeof(CompactionEntry), "compaction")]
abstract class SessionEntry { }

class MessageEntry : SessionEntry { public string Content { get; set; } = string.Empty; }
class CompactionEntry : SessionEntry { public int From { get; set; } }

var json = """{"$type":"message","Content":"hello"}"""u8;
var result = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<SessionEntry>(json);
// result is MessageEntry at runtime
```

| Feature | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Serialization + Deserialization | ✅ v2026.3.0 |
| Streaming (PipeReader) | ✅ v2026.3.2 |
| Base class properties | ✅ v2026.3.3 |
| `[JsonConstructor]` on derived types | ✅ |
| Record derived types | ✅ v2026.3.23 |
| Complex/collection ctor params | ✅ v2026.3.24 |
| TOML / YAML poly support | ✅ v2026.3.24 |
| INI / MsgPack poly support | ✅ v2026.4.0 |

### DOM Layer (PicoDocument / PicoElement)

Schema-less JSON inspection without `System.Text.Json`. Zero-copy.

```csharp
var doc = PicoDocument.Parse("""{"name":"Alice","age":30}"""u8.ToArray());

var name = doc.RootElement["name"].GetString();         // "Alice"
var ok   = doc.RootElement.TryGetProperty("age", out _); // true
bool valid = PicoDocument.IsValid("{}"u8);               // true

// Numeric access
long big = doc.RootElement["count"].GetInt64();
double d = doc.RootElement["score"].GetDouble();
if (doc.RootElement["age"].TryGetInt32(out int age))
    Console.WriteLine(age);
```

### C# Records

`record` and `record struct` types are fully supported. Primary constructor auto-detected — no `[JsonConstructor]` needed. `init`-only properties work correctly.

### Top-Level Arrays

`Serialize<T[]>(...)` / `Deserialize<T[]>(...)` and streaming `DeserializeFromStreamAsync<T[]>(stream)` work directly.

### Arrays and Dictionaries

Records (`record`/`record struct` primary constructors) work in every format —
JSON, MsgPack, TOML, YAML and INI — without a format-specific constructor
attribute.

Field-level object arrays (`TObject[]`, `List<TObject[]>`, `TObject[][]`) round-trip
in JSON, MsgPack, TOML and YAML (INI drops object collections because its format
is flat — see
[Format limits](#format-limits-what-each-wire-format-cannot-express) for which
of those drops surface as a build warning). An object sequence *inside* a nested
object round-trips in YAML too (block sequences; see
[PicoYaml → Limits](PicoYaml/README.md#limits)). TOML keeps its
documented loud "nested tables deeper than one level" error. TOML arrays of tables have no chunk-resume strategy, so their streaming
delegate is not registered — `DeserializeFromStreamAsync` then buffers the stream
and uses the synchronous path (correct, just not incremental). Dictionaries accept
scalar, object and nested-dictionary values; a **collection** dict value
(`Dictionary<string, List<T>>`) is dropped with `PICOSERDE004` instead of
generating broken code.

### Nullable Elements

`List<int?>`, `List<string?>`, `List<TObject?>`, `Dictionary<string, TObject?>`
and nested lists of objects round-trip in JSON and MsgPack, including null
elements. TOML and YAML have no null *type*: null *scalar elements* are skipped
on write, and a **nullable element** (`List<int?>`, a nullable object/dict
element, or `int?` at any depth of a nested chain) is dropped with the
`PICOSERDE004` warning. Nested lists themselves are a separate axis — TOML and
YAML both express them (see
[Format limits](#format-limits-what-each-wire-format-cannot-express)). INI cannot
represent any nullable element and drops those members the same way.

### Format limits: what each wire format cannot express

Not every C# shape has a wire representation in every format. The matrix below is
the boundary of the five generated serializers. Every ❌ is enforced at
**generation time**, never at runtime. A member the format cannot express is left
out of the generated serializer and the build reports `PICOSERDE004` —
`Member 'X.Y' cannot be represented by this format — it will be ignored` — while a
self-referencing member reports `PICOSERDE003` —
`Member 'X.Y' is recursive/self-referencing and cannot be represented by this format — it will be ignored`.
The rest of the document is written and read as usual, so the drop shows up in the
build log instead of surfacing later as a mysteriously empty property.

| Shape (C#) | JSON | MsgPack | TOML | YAML | INI |
|---|---|:---:|---|---|---|
| `List<Dto>` — list of objects | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `[[Table]]` | ✅ block sequence of mappings | ❌ see ¹ |
| `List<List<int>>` — nested primitive list | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `G = [[1, 2], [3]]` | ✅ nested block sequence | ❌ `PICOSERDE004` |
| `List<List<Dto>>` — list of lists of objects | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ `G = [[{ Name = "a" }]]` | ✅ nested block sequence | ❌ `PICOSERDE004` |
| `List<List<int?>>` — nullable leaf in a nested list | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ `PICOSERDE004` | ✅ `- null` | ❌ `PICOSERDE004` |
| Recursive member (`Node? Child`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ nested tables (`[Child]`) ³ | ✅ nested mappings ³ | ❌ `PICOSERDE003` ³ |

✅ means the generated code both writes and reads the shape, and each ✅ shape is
exercised by a round-trip test in the suite. Both diagnostics are
`Warning`-severity and are created with `Location.None`, so
`#pragma warning disable` cannot silence them — suppress them by id in `NoWarn`
only if you accept the data loss.

**How to confirm, in one command** (the default build prints them):

```bash
dotnet build 2>&1 | grep PICOSERDE
# PowerShell: dotnet build 2>&1 | Select-String PICOSERDE
```

¹ **INI object lists.** INI has no array-of-tables syntax, so a `List<SomeDto>`
**member** cannot be represented and is dropped — reported as `PICOSERDE004` like
every other unrepresentable shape (it used to be a bare `continue`, the one silent
loss in the generator; that path is instrumented now). A **top-level**
`List<SomeDto>` does round-trip in INI: each item becomes a numbered section
(`[0]`, `[1]`, …). For an object list *inside* a DTO use TOML, YAML or JSON.

² **YAML nullable leaves.** YAML can express a null (`null`, `Null`, `NULL` or `~`),
so a nullable leaf is written as the null literal — `List<int?>`, `List<List<int?>>`,
`List<string?>`, `List<Dto?>` and `Dictionary<string, int?>` all round-trip, with
"null" (a value), "empty" (an empty collection) and "missing" (no member at all) kept
apart. TOML has no null literal at all, which is why the same shapes are dropped
there; the generator diagnostic, not this table, is the authority for your build.

³ **Recursion.** The row above is the self-referencing *member* (`Node? Child`):
it round-trips in every format except INI, which drops it with `PICOSERDE003`
while the type's other members still round-trip — a recursive DTO therefore
still serializes "partially" there. JSON and MsgPack keep it too (cycle-safe
extraction + seeded helpers, including on polymorphic bases) — see
[Streaming](#streaming-incremental-chunked). Two further *positions* a cycle can
sit in are **not** covered by the ✅: a recursive collection **element**
(`List<Node>` **on `Node`**) and a recursive **dict value**
(`Dictionary<string, Node>` on `Node`) are closed in JSON and MsgPack only —
TOML and YAML still drop those members with `PICOSERDE003`, reported as a debt
(`⏸`, reopen: the format can carry one, the emitter has no route for a table
inside an array yet).

Two shapes sit outside this matrix. A **collection dictionary value**
(`Dictionary<string, List<T>>`; nested dictionaries are fine) is dropped in
**every** format with `PICOSERDE004`. A **top-level scalar** target is not dropped
at all but refused outright — `Serialize<Guid>()`, `Deserialize<int?>()` and friends fail
loudly with `InvalidOperationException` ("no serializer registered").

The wire shape behind each ✅ is documented per format:
[PicoToml](PicoToml/README.md#limits) (`[[Table]]`, `G = [[1, 2], [3]]`),
[PicoYaml](PicoYaml/README.md#limits) (block sequences, `- []` vs `- "[]"`),
[PicoIni](PicoIni/README.md#limits), [PicoJetson](PicoJetson/README.md#limits),
[PicoMsgPack](PicoMsgPack/README.md#limits).

### Streaming (incremental, chunked)

`DeserializeFromStreamAsync<T>(stream, options, ct)` reads a stream
incrementally: for JSON/TOML/YAML/INI the consumed prefix is released as tokens
complete and only the current token/member window is retained, so the document
is never buffered wholesale before parsing.

**MsgPack is the exception — its stream path is a buffering implementation.**
Each read is appended to an accumulator and the whole buffer is re-parsed from
the beginning until the value is complete (correct, and it resumes cleanly, but
it is not incremental and costs O(n²) in the number of chunks).

JSON/TOML/YAML/INI accept an options argument
(`JsonOptions`/`TomlOptions`/`YamlOptions`/`IniOptions`). MsgPack also has a
`MsgPackOptions` type, but its `DeserializeFromStreamAsync` overload takes
`(stream, ct)` only — options are not accepted on the streaming path.

```csharp
await using var stream = File.OpenRead("config.toml");
var config = await TomlSerializer.DeserializeFromStreamAsync<ServerConfig>(stream);
```

The generated delegate returns a `ReadStatus`:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Success` | The value is complete |
| `NeedMoreData` | The current chunk ends inside a token/section; the runner refills and resumes from the reader's mark |
| `EndOfInput` | The document contains no value — the runner throws `FormatException` |

**Empty-stream semantics** match the synchronous path: TOML/YAML/INI treat an
empty stream as an empty object; JSON throws `FormatException` ("the document
contains no value").

**Recursive DTOs**: JSON and MsgPack support self- and mutually-referencing
types (cycle-safe extraction + seeded helpers), including recursive members on
polymorphic bases — nested values keep their derived (discriminator) type in
both the sync and chunked streaming paths. TOML/YAML/INI cannot express
unbounded nesting, so the recursive member is skipped and the source generator
reports `PICOSERDE003` (never silent). Data-level object graph cycles fail
loudly instead of overflowing the stack.

**Polymorphic hierarchies**: a concrete polymorphic base instance serializes
with a synthesized discriminator (the base type name, collision-safe) so base
instances round-trip as the base type; derived instances keep their declared
discriminator. They also keep nested object/dict members *and* collection
members (`List<T>`, `Dictionary<string,T>`) of derived types in JSON, MsgPack,
TOML and YAML (previously dropped or non-compiling in the discriminator
branches); INI ignores nested members because its format is flat.

**Diagnostics** (warnings):
`PICOSERDE001` — a property type the generator cannot resolve was ignored.
`PICOSERDE002` — two distinct types produced the same generated file name
(main hint); internal helper names get a stable hash suffix (`UniqueName`).
`PICOSERDE003` — a recursive member was skipped by a section-based format.
`PICOSERDE004` — a member shape the format cannot represent (a nested list the
format has no syntax for, a nullable value-type element, a null object element,
a collection dictionary value) was skipped.
`PICOSERDE005` — an anonymous-type collection member was skipped by a format
whose writer cannot emit one (JSON is the only writer that can).
See [Format limits](#format-limits-what-each-wire-format-cannot-express) for the
support matrix behind `PICOSERDE003`/`PICOSERDE004`.

**Custom/advanced registration** (scripts or hand-written serializers):
`JsonSerializer.RegisterStreaming<T>(StreamingFunc<JsonReader, T> func)` with
`where T : notnull`; `HasStreamingDelegate<T>()` reports whether a delegate is
registered. The source generator emits this registration in a
`ModuleInitializer` for every discovered type.

### Three-Layer Test Structure

PicoJetson tests are split into Unit / Integration / Functional projects with clear boundaries.

> **No non-generic `Serialize(Type, object?)` overloads.** PicoSerDe is designed for AOT-first
> usage where all types are known at compile time. `SerRegistry<TFormat, T>` static fields (PicoSerDe.Core) are shared
> across assemblies and provide faster lookup than a `ConcurrentDictionary<Type, ...>`.
> Framework wrappers should call the generic API internally — the type's serializer is
> guaranteed to be registered via `ModuleInitializer` as long as the type was discovered
> by any pipeline (usage-driven, attribute, or shorthand).

  .Gen     .Gen       .Gen      .Gen     .Gen      ← embedded in each runtime nupkg
```

- **One-package install**: each format → runtime library (net10.0) with its source generator (netstandard2.0) **embedded** in the nupkg (`analyzers/dotnet/cs` + `build/PicoX.targets`) — a single `PackageReference` is enough; standalone `.Gen` packages are legacy/optional
- **`ref struct`** readers/writers — stack-allocated, zero heap allocation on hot path
- **Static `SerRegistry<TFormat, T>`** — per-format registries in PicoSerDe.Core; JIT/AOT inlineable, no dictionary lookups
- **`file struct`** generated implementations — devirtualization without sealed class overhead
- **Ref struct serialization** — `ref struct` types are supported as serializable types across all 5 formats. Source-generator-generated static methods + delegate dispatch bypass the `ISerializer<T>` interface constraint.
- **`JsonOptions`** — runtime configuration (indentation, naming policy, ignore conditions, etc.) passed **explicitly per call** (no ambient ThreadStatic state; options thread through reader/writer instances and SG-generated code)
- **Polymorphic deserialization** — type discriminator dispatch via `[PicoDerivedType]`; serialization + deserialization + streaming (v2026.3.0); record types (v2026.3.23); TOML/YAML poly (v2026.3.24); INI/MsgPack poly (v2026.4.0)
- **Anonymous type serialization** — `Serialize(new { A = 1, B = "x" })` with nested types, collections, `PropertyNamingPolicy.CamelCase`, `DefaultIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull`, and `MaxDepth` enforcement. Works across all 5 formats via C# 12 interceptors + unsafe field access (serialization only, C# 12+, `<AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>`) (v2026.4.1)
- **`PicoDocument` / `PicoElement`** — zero-copy JSON DOM for schema-less inspection (v2026.3.4)
- **C# records** — primary constructor auto-detection, `init`-only support (v2026.3.3); poly+record (v2026.3.23); complex/collection ctor params (v2026.3.24)
- **Top-level arrays** — `Serialize<T[]>()` / `Deserialize<T[]>()` with streaming (v2026.3.2)
- **Top-level scalars / `Nullable<T>` are not supported** — `Serialize<Guid>(...)`, `Deserialize<int?>(...)` etc. fail loudly with `InvalidOperationException` ("no serializer registered") instead of emitting an empty object or non-compiling generated code
- **Deep object nesting** — JSON/YAML/MsgPack round-trip objects nested 3+ levels; INI/TOML currently support a single nested level and throw `NotSupportedException` beyond that (loudly, instead of silently losing data).
- **INI nested object lists** — a `List<SomeDto>` property cannot be represented by INI's flat sections and is dropped by `IniSerializer` (reported as `PICOSERDE004` since this release, with the member name and format; see [Format limits](#format-limits-what-each-wire-format-cannot-express)); scalar lists (`List<int>`, `List<string>`, ...) round-trip.

### PicoJetson JsonOptions

```csharp
// Compact (default) — optimal for data transfer
byte[] data = JsonSerializer.SerializeToUtf8Bytes(model);

// Human-readable
byte[] data = JsonSerializer.SerializeToUtf8Bytes(model,
    new JsonOptions { Indented = true });

// CamelCase naming
byte[] data = JsonSerializer.SerializeToUtf8Bytes(model,
    new JsonOptions { PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase });

// Skip null properties
byte[] data = JsonSerializer.SerializeToUtf8Bytes(model,
    new JsonOptions { DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull });

// Allow NaN/Infinity
byte[] data = JsonSerializer.SerializeToUtf8Bytes(model,
    new JsonOptions { NumberHandling = JsonNumberHandling.AllowNamedFloatingPointLiterals });
```

Available options:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|:-------:|-------------|
| `Indented` | `false` | Human-readable indented output |
| `MaxDepth` | `63` | Maximum nesting depth |
| `PropertyNamingPolicy` | `null` | Naming policy: `CamelCase`, `SnakeCaseLower`, `KebabCaseLower`, `PascalCase` |
| `DefaultIgnoreCondition` | `Never` | Skip null/default properties: `WhenWritingNull`, `WhenWritingDefault` |
| `NumberHandling` | `Strict` | Allow named floats: `AllowNamedFloatingPointLiterals` |
| `PropertyNameCaseInsensitive` | `true` | Property matching is case-insensitive by default; set `false` for exact case-sensitive matching |
| `AllowTrailingCommas` | `false` | Accept trailing commas in objects/arrays |
| `ReadCommentHandling` | `Disallow` | Skip `//` and `/* */` comments |
| `UnmappedMemberHandling` | `Skip` | Throw on unknown properties: `Disallow` |

#### Null handling across formats

Every format's options class (`JsonOptions`, `YamlOptions`, `TomlOptions`, `IniOptions`, `MsgPackOptions`) exposes `DefaultIgnoreCondition`, but what "writing a null" means depends on the wire format:

| Format | Default (`Never`) | `WhenWritingNull` |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| JSON | `"key":null` written | omitted |
| MsgPack | `nil` written (map count adjusts automatically) | omitted |
| TOML / INI | omitted — these formats have no null value | omitted |
| YAML | omitted — YAML has no null value on write; writing `key:` would read back as a default value and break round-trip fidelity | omitted |

> All three section-based formats still *read* an explicit null literal
> (`Key =`, `Key:`, `~`, unquoted `null`) — see
> [Null Semantics](#null-semantics) for the full per-format matrix.

The matrix applies to every emit path — top-level members, nested objects, collection elements, nullable collections, and polymorphic dispatch — and is locked by cross-format regression tests (`IgnoreConditionMatrixTests`).

> **Honored options:** JSON and MsgPack read `DefaultIgnoreCondition` from their options objects. INI/TOML/YAML always omit nulls because those wire formats have no null *value* on the write side; their `DefaultIgnoreCondition` property is accepted by the public API but the generated code treats nulls as always omitted. `Indented = true` is honored: YAML additionally indents sequence items under their key, TOML indents table contents, and INI indents section contents (the compact default is unchanged).

Per-property control is available via the cross-format `[PicoIgnore]` attribute (PicoSerDe.Core):

```csharp
[PicoIgnore]                                                  // stripped everywhere (write + read)
public string Internal { get; set; } = "";

[PicoIgnore(Condition = PicoIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull)] // omitted only when null, regardless of global options
public string? Note { get; set; }

[PicoIgnore(Condition = PicoIgnoreCondition.Never)]           // exempt from the global DefaultIgnoreCondition
public string? Pinned { get; set; }
```

Conditions affect serialization only — deserialization still maps conditional properties. Format-specific markers (`[JsonIgnore]`, `[YamlIgnore]`, …) remain single-format unconditional ignores.

#### Custom serializers for nested types

`Register` applies at the top level only. To also override `T` wherever it appears as a **nested** value (object property, list element, dictionary value), use `RegisterCustom` — available on JSON and MessagePack:

```csharp
JsonSerializer.RegisterCustom(new MySerializer(), new MyDeserializer());
// Outer { Foo Inner } now serializes Inner with MySerializer too.
// Deserialization override applies at the top level only.
```

## Shared Attribute Hierarchy

Per-format attributes (`[JsonIgnore]`, `[IniKey]`, ...) inherit shared PicoSerDe.Core bases
(`PicoIgnoreAttribute`, `PicoSerializableAttribute`, `PicoCamelCaseAttribute`,
`PicoConstructorAttribute`, `PicoDateTimeFormatAttribute`, `PicoConverterAttribute`) —
one implementation per concept, format-specific public names preserved. `IniKeyAttribute.Key`
is the canonical property (`Name` is an obsolete alias).

## Packages

> Each runtime package embeds its generator (`analyzers/dotnet/cs`); the standalone `*.Gen` packages are legacy/optional — installing both would load a duplicate analyzer.

## CI/CD

| Target | Runner |
|--------|--------|
| win-x64 | windows-latest |
| win-arm64 | windows-latest |
| linux-x64 | ubuntu-latest |
| linux-arm64 | ubuntu-24.04-arm |
| osx-arm64 | macos-latest |

Every push: build + the full test suite + 5 benchmarks smoke + 5 AOT sample publishes.
Release: `v*` tag → packs 11 packages in dependency order → NuGet.org.
Local feed: run `./scripts/release.ps1 -Version <ver>` **before** pushing the
tag — it runs the test suite, packs all 11 packages into `artifacts/nupkg`
(declared as the `local` NuGet source in `NuGet.config`), then tags and pushes.
Sibling PicoHex repos add the same folder path after nuget.org in their
`NuGet.config` to consume the new version instantly, bypassing nuget.org's
indexing window and 30-minute HTTP cache.

AOT tiers - declare `<AotOptimizationLevel>` per project (`minimal` default /
`aggressive` for samples/benchmarks). Implementations: `minimal` in
`Directory.Build.props` (PublishAot + TrimMode=full), `aggressive` in
`Directory.Build.targets` (adds `StackTraceSupport=false` +
`UseSystemResourceKeys=true`; classic `Ilc*` MSBuild properties are removed in
.NET 10 SDK >= 10.0.400 and silently ignored) - the aggressive block lives in
targets so a csproj-level declaration is visible when it evaluates.
Libraries declare `IsAotCompatible`+`IsTrimmable`; only source generators
(`PicoXxx.Gen`, netstandard2.0) never AOT.
